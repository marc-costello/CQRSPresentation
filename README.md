CQRSPresentation
================

**RavenDb** will need to be installed, if you wish to play with this. 

The application currently has the settings `{ Url = "http://ravendb:8080", DefaultDatabase = "CQRSPres" }`.
Which looks for a RavenDb instance running at http://ravendb:8080. The database _CQRSPres_ will be created automatically.

If you need to change the db settings, you will find them in the global.asax. Simples.
